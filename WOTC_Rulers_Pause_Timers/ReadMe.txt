This mod sets up enemies to [b]SUSPEND[/b] the Mission Timer, much like how the Chosen do. The default settings are just for the three DLC rulers but the list can be expanded by config

Also contains a new console commands that lets you pause/resume the timer at will..
[code]
Timer_Suspend (bResumeMissionTimer)
[/code]

[h1]Why the mod?[/h1]
... ever had a mission where a roof collapsed and the 1 tile away evac just got flung half the map away, yet you've still only got the next turn to get there?
-pause the timer by console, fux that bs!

Got frustrated with an enemy soaking up all your mission time due to it's ridiculously large modded HP pool, but still want to actually have that battle?
-set that enemy on the auto-list (I'm thinking of custodians, cx'zerkers and riftkeepers.. maybe even ABA primes, added rulers, etc)

I wanted to disable timers, but only when facing other Chosen-like 'boss' enemies... this mod lets me do that.
At first this was just the extra console command because I couldn't find one in the default commands, but then I decided it would be cool to automate it depending on current visable enemy.
I made this mod for myself, but then decided to share it. 

I've found in playing, with modded enemies in particular, the default game timers are too short but the second wave double timers are too long. I was trying to find a good 'middle ground'.

The mod shouldn't care if there are multiple of the units on the field with the ability, it pauses the timer on 'sight' and resumes it on start of alien turn and deaths... 
... as long as one unit with the ability is in play the timer will be paused for XCOMs turn. This can be configured to either be 'active enemies only' or 'any spotted by XCOM'.

Just for information, the normal timer is blue, the suspended timer is grey.

[h1]Configuration/ Bugs ETC[/h1]
Obviously due to the sheer number of enemy mods and personal preference I cannot possibly guess what enemies you might want to set this up for, I also can't test every enemy...
... however the list of enemies that recieve the ability is configureable. Just add their character template to the list. I tested it with most mission types that have timers.

For a respectable list of all current enemy mods and the template names required you can check out this amazing steam guide here;

You can also decide to give units on the list (and the Chosen) a Passive Icon showcasing this ability in enemy viewers, like YetAnotherF1 etc.

You can also choose to have it apply when XCOM spots a unit from concealment or if the enemy must be revealed and active.

As always bug-reports welcome :)
